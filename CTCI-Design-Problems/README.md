This directory contain a set of examples with code sample which I used to learn design problems from CTCI 6th edition.
Below is key summary point that should be considered while solving any design problem at OOD level.

1.Requirment gathering : define use cases for given problem ,seek clarification in terms of constraints and it's utility
2.Define the core functionality of the design system and identify the core object and action those object will perform
3.Create classes & objects that will be needed to support core functionality as defiened in #2
4. Utilize OOP such as abstract classes ,Interface and other techniques to avoid duplication, Uneceesary work
5. Identify the suitable data structure and algorithm needed to solve the given problem.
